(In order from left to right)
If there are no objects when you open the project, please open the sample scene.

1. Ripple Shader: Uses functions to warp UV coordinates, creating a water ripple effect.

2. Diffuse Lighting with Shadow: Calculates diffuse lighting based on the main light source and overlays real-time shadows.

3. Glass Shader: Achieves semi-transparent refraction using Fresnel edge lighting and normal perturbation.

4. Water Shader: Adds sinusoidal displacement at the vertex stage to create a dynamic water surface effect.

5. UV Scroll: Dynamically scrolls two layers of textures (main texture + foam) to simulate a flowing surface.
